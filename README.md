# Random Password Generator

## How the program work?

#### The program generates a random password of a certain length,
#### The password must contain a mix of letters, numbers and special characters and the length of the password must be supplied by the user,
#### If the length is less than 4, print an error message and ask the user to provide a new length,
#### The password must be random, so each time the user runs the program, a new password must be generated,
#### The password must contain at least one letter, one number and one special character,
#### The password cannot contain blanks.
#### We will use the 'random' librarie and 'string' librarie

##
The program must contain a function called `gerar_senha` that takes the length of the password as a parameter and returns the generated password. If the length is invalid, the function must return None.

Example output:
`Enter password length: 10`

`8Zn$*2q9X`
